DESCRIPTION The BFL combines parts of the Beach, Desert and Mountain Loops into a single big loop, resulting in the BFL (Big F*****g Loop) acronymn. This is the perfect option to experience the diversity that San Diego County offers if you do not have time to do the 3 loops individually.
The route starts and ends at the Julian Pie Company in Julian. The address is 2225 Main Street, Julian, CA 92036.</description></item><item><title>Beach Loop</title><link>https://nkawu.github.io/jbpc_hugo_intro/projects/beach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nkawu.github.io/jbpc_hugo_intro/projects/beach/</guid><description>Mountains to the beach and back again

DESCRIPTION This loop puts the challenge in the Julian Bikepack Challenge! The loop begins with a descent from Julian to Banner, where you will start a climb over to Cuyamaca Rancho State Park for some great singletrack. The singletrack will have you working your way over to Mount Laguna via Indian Creek Trail, which is sure to test your climbing ability. Then the incredible singletrack playground of Mount Laguna awaits you before you are sent down to Pine Valley on one of the most epic singletrack runs in the country namely Noble Canyon.</description></item></channel></rss>
